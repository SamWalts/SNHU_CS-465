Architecture

In the full stack project, I had the opportunity to work with multiple types of front-end development technologies, each with its own strengths and use cases. The primary approaches included using Express HTML, JavaScript, and a Single Page Application (SPA) framework, Angular.
Express HTML development is straightforward and well-suited for simpler applications or for serving static content. It relies on server-side rendering, where HTML pages are generated on the server and sent to the client as complete documents. This method is easy to implement and ensures that the content is immediately available for search engines, improving SEO. However, it can result in slower user experiences due to the need to reload entire pages with each navigation.
Vanilla JavaScript, on the other hand, allowed for more dynamic interactions within these static HTML pages. By manipulating the DOM, JavaScript can update the UI without requiring a full page reload, leading to a more responsive user experience. This approach is still limited by the fact that each interaction typically requires a new request to the server, which can slow down performance as the complexity of the application increases.
The SPA architecture, implemented using Angular, represents a more modern approach. In this setup, the entire application is loaded once, and JavaScript handles all subsequent user interactions on the client side. This results in a snappier feel for the User, and less work on the server side.
On the backend, a NoSQL MongoDB database was chosen primarily due to its flexibility and scalability. Unlike relational databases, MongoDB stores data in a schema-less format, allowing for easy handling of unstructured data. 

Functionality

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for both humans and machines to read and write. Although it shares similarities with JavaScript in its syntax, JSON is a text format that is language independent. This makes it an ideal format for exchanging data between the frontend and backend of a web application.
In the context of the full stack project, JSON serves as the bridge between the client and server. When a user interacts with the frontend, the SPA sends or receives data in JSON format to and from the backend API. This allows the frontend to dynamically update the UI based on the data received, without needing to reload the page.
Throughout the development process, I often refactored code to improve functionality and efficiency. For instance, I refactored the way data was fetched and displayed by implementing reusable UI components in Angular. Instead of duplicating code across multiple parts of the application, I created components that could be used in different contexts with minimal modification. This not only made the codebase cleaner and more maintainable but also ensured that any updates to the UI could be applied consistently across the application.
The benefits of reusable UI components are significant. They reduce the amount of code duplication, making the application easier to maintain and update. Using a modular framework like Angular made debugging each part of the application much simpler.

Testing

Testing a full stack application requires a comprehensive approach, particularly when dealing with API endpoints and the added complexity of security layers. API testing involves verifying that the various endpoints behave as expected under different conditions. This includes testing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, ensuring that data is correctly processed and stored by the backend.
Methods and endpoints are integral to API design. A method refers to the type of HTTP request being made (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), while an endpoint is the specific URL where the API listens for these requests. For example, a GET request to /api/users might retrieve a list of users, while a POST request to /api/users might create a new user. 
Security adds another layer of complexity to testing. Using the Postman API testing software, I was able to test the security of the web app, as well as the HTTP functions. Testing with the security context involved verifying that the security measures, such as token-based authentication or OAuth, are correctly implemented and that unauthorized requests are appropriately blocked. This also requires testing the application's ability to handle different user roles and permissions, ensuring that each user can only access the data and functionality they are entitled to.

Reflection

This course has been instrumental in advancing my professional goals, particularly in the realm of full stack development. It has provided me with a deep understanding of how the different layers of a web application interact, from the frontend UI to the backend database, and how to effectively manage and optimize these interactions.
One of the most valuable skills I’ve developed during this course is the ability to work with modern frontend frameworks like Angular. This has helped me gain familiarity with SPA’s that will carry on through my career. I’ve also honed my skills in backend development, particularly in writing API’s for NoSQL databases like MongoDB, which are crucial for handling the flexible data structures often required in modern applications.
Moreover, the course has emphasized the importance of writing clean, maintainable code and the benefits of modular design. By focusing on creating reusable components and services, I’ve learned how to build applications that are not only easier to maintain but also more scalable. This will undoubtedly serve me well in future projects, whether I’m working on small-scale applications or large, complex systems.
